This post is an attempt to organize my thoughts regarding the framework, as basic as they might be by having such little exposure to it.</p>

While this is fairly simple to do in web servers where each request has its own execution environment (be it a thread or a process), Node's single-process single-thread model makes it less straightforward - but it can be achieved with the help of <a href="https://github.com/othiym23/node-continuation-local-storage"><code>continuation-local-storage</code></a>.</p>

I wanted the documentation to live next to the code, and the tooling to generate a nice site from it. Finally I settled for <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> and used a combination of packages to get the job done.</p>

I'm used to working either with Rails, where these kind of things are mostly provided by gems that make all the decisions for you; or on small Node projects which didn't require authentication at all. So this was new and required me to do some research about alternatives and implementation details.</p>

JST allows you to write HTML templates for your JS library of choice, and it exposes them in a <code>JST</code> global object on the client side, using their path relative to the Javascript asset's path as the key. They play nicely with Angular.js and there's a way to make Angular &quot;JST aware&quot; so to speak.</p>

sidebar. The application we were building had a preview to the left and the fixed sidebar to the
right to tweak that preview. The problem to solve is how to give the sidebar the proper height so
it will scroll its content correctly.</p>
